                 <h2class="welcome_message" Hello!!  Welcome to my Portfolio Project that I created while attending class
                      @ <a href="https://www.momentumlearn.com/"> Momentum Learning</a>
                </h2>

                <p class="my_comments"> Just a short 2 weeks ago I made the decision to join this cohort. 
                 I was scared and I was tense. To be hoest with you, I'm still scared and I'm still tense.
                 It is getting better everyday. My instructors and fellow students are a tremendous encouragement.
                 I started creating the website you are viewing on day 4 of this class.  I can't wait to 
                 look back on this project once I have completed the cohort, and hopefully see that I 
                 have come a long way!
